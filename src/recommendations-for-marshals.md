# Security suggestions for NYC-DSA Marshalling group

### Trust But Verify
Anyone should be able to take the training, no questions asked. But before a person can actually marshal they should be checked out at least a little bit (not a cop, not a nazi, basically)

### Share As Much As Possible, But Not Everything
Regardless of how information is shared, general info should be available to everyone who wants it. Email lists, google drive, more general signal groups, etc. But specifics of planning and marshalling actions should be on a need to know basis, ideally limited to those who have received training, been vetted, and have volunteered for said action. This could be done ideally in person, or could be done via a video conference where only the volunteers have access

### Handling The Email List
List signups should be digital to mitigate potential theft (don’t use an easily swipe-able paper list, people have stolen these in the past). As mentioned in the above point, email lists should be kept as general as possible. You shouldn’t be worrying about who is or isn’t on the email list

### Phones
It’s unrealistic to expect people to leave their phones behind at an action. Instead, mitigate the risk by asking (and verifying) that all marshals/medics have disabled thumb/face ID and have instead set a PIN or similar lock instead. Nothing stops a cop from forcing your thumb down onto your phone, or putting your face in front of your phone’s camera, but if you use a PIN or passphrase, they can’t coerce you to unlock it against your will. At least, not right there at the action (buy yourself some time). When promoting an action, we should encourage attendees to do this, but obviously we can’t and shouldn’t enforce it.

### Use Signal
Most communication should happen face to face or via radio, but if you absolutely need to text during an action, use Signal. A Signal group for all the marshalls at an action should be set up prior to the action starting. All marshals/medics/etc should set their Signal to auto-delete messages and lock with a passphrase, at least during the duration of the action. Marshals should hold each other accountable to make sure that Signal settings are correct and face/thumbprint ID has been turned off on everyone’s phones. Ideally, this Signal group should be in use prior to the action as well for planning purposes.

### Practice Radical Consent
People are going to take photos at actions. However some comrades might be taking risks by attending an action. Because of this, we should do our best to ensure we have people’s consent before we post their photo to social media. We definitely should not tag people (let them tag themselves if they want to). We should also establish a clear policy for removing photos on request, no questions asked (since getting consent from every person at a large action would be logistically impossible).

While documenting actions, you might end up recording photos or video that could be used as evidence in court. If you suspect you’ve captured something like this, it’s best to hand the original files over to the Marshals to figure out the best way forward.
